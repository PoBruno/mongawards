-- Fix voting system permissions and RLS policies
-- This script fixes the voting system completely

-- First, ensure the individual_votes table exists
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS individual_votes (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID NOT NULL,
    nominee_id UUID REFERENCES nominees(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    category_id UUID REFERENCES categories(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(user_id, category_id) -- One vote per user per category
);

-- Add indexes if they don't exist
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_individual_votes_user ON individual_votes(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_individual_votes_nominee ON individual_votes(nominee_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_individual_votes_category ON individual_votes(category_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_individual_votes_nominee_category ON individual_votes(nominee_id, category_id);

-- DISABLE RLS for individual_votes table (since we're using custom auth)
ALTER TABLE individual_votes DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Also disable RLS for user_votes if it's causing issues
ALTER TABLE user_votes DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their individual votes" ON individual_votes;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their individual votes" ON individual_votes;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their votes" ON user_votes;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their votes" ON user_votes;

-- Grant permissions to anon and authenticated users
GRANT ALL ON individual_votes TO anon;
GRANT ALL ON individual_votes TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON user_votes TO anon;
GRANT ALL ON user_votes TO authenticated;

-- Test insert to make sure it works
DO $$
BEGIN
    -- Try to insert a test vote (will be deleted immediately)
    INSERT INTO individual_votes (user_id, nominee_id, category_id) 
    SELECT

        n.id,
        c.id
    FROM nominees n, categories c 
    LIMIT 1;
    
    -- Delete the test vote
